# hello.t1616.echo
 
This is a version of the ["hello.echo"](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/index.html#echo) board for Week 6 of Fab Academy, designed for the ATTiny1616 microcontroller.  This particular chip is not included in Neil Gershenfeld's "hello.echo" boards, and we happen to have a lot of them.

Program using Spence Konde's [megaTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore) for Arduino, and a [pyUPDI-style](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/blob/master/MakeUPDIProgrammer.md) FTDI-to-UDPI adapter.

Materials:
* 1 uF 1206 SMD capacitor
* SOIC-20W ATTiny1616-S
* 1x6 2.54 mm pitch horizontal male SMD header
* 1x3 2.54 mm pitch horizontal male SMD header
